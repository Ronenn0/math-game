# Math Game 🧠➕✖️

This is a simple **JavaScript-powered math game** I built in **2022 during my military service**. It was part of my self-learning journey in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, created without tutorials — just logic, creativity, and the knowledge I had at the time.

Although it's not professionally polished, it still works and represents my growth as a developer.

- User types the answer and submits
- Score increases for each correct answer
- Great for practicing quick mental calculations

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## ✍️ Why I Made It

- Built this while serving in the military to keep learning and stay sharp
- Practiced basic logic, random generation, and user input handling
- Wanted to prove to myself that even under pressure, I can keep improving

## 📚 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation
- Handling user input with JS
- Using randomness in game logic
- Simple feedback loops and scoring

## ✅ Status

✅ Fully functional  
❌ Not responsive / mobile-optimized  
⚠️ Early-stage code quality (built without best practices)
